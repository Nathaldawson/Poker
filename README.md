# Hold'em – Minimal Casino-Style Poker

A single-player heads-up Texas Hold'em game in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Modern, understated casino look – no tacky chrome.

## Run
Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari). No build step.

## Features
- Heads-up vs. simple dealer AI
- Blinds, pot, betting/raising, calls/checks/folds
- 7-card evaluator (best of 21 combos)
- Clean card render, dark felt table, subtle accents

## Notes
- The AI uses a lightweight heuristic; it’s meant to be fun, not unbeatable.
- Minimum bet is the big blind; raises use the slider or quick buttons.
